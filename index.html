        <h3>The Great Wall of China:</h3> The Great Wall of China is in fact one of world’s most talked-about <br>tourist attraction. And to walk through the Wall isn’t suggested because of its hype. There are different regions, most of which aren’t even known<br> to<br> tourists, which you can explore and where you can indulge in various amazing adventure.
       <div><p> The Taj Mahal needs no introduction, as we have often seen people posting<br> photographs with the Taj in cliche poses. But to go off the beaten track, you have to behold this masterpiece during a full moon, when <br>the Taj Mahal seems to slightly change its hues complementing the moonlight.</p></div><br>

        <h3>Sajek Valley Tour: </h3> of The Hills & Clouds
        I along with my partner, traveled to Sajek Valley, Rangamati, Bangladesh a few days ago. This was by far the best tour of my life. As I was planning for such a tour for a very long time, I went through different travel guide pages and was looking for someone who will arrange the tour in an enjoyable way.
        Then I met Rocky Hasan from Cholo Bangladesh Tours and this guy is really awesome. He has given the tour plan beforehand so that we can be prepared for the upcoming tour. He has also confirmed resort booking, bus tickets, and jeep booking before the trip.</div>

            <h3>Review of: Food Tour in Dhaka :</h3> Taste the Best Foods of Dhaka
            This was a fantastically authentic and local tour of Old Dhaka. I booked a hotel pick-up and the guide, Itman, and driver arrived on time and were very polite. The tour itself used the local rickshaw as our primary means of transportation, which was adventurous and exciting to wind in and out of Dhaka's roads!
            
            The food was fantatsic, ranging from local snacks found inside the Dhaka Univerdity Campus, to traditional Biryani at one of the most famous stores.
            
            Itman and Mohammad were fantastic guides and spending the day with them was more like spending time with friends. They were great company as well as being very knowledgeable.
            
            Before the tour ended I met the Company's director, Rocky, who was very helpful in organising this tour for me. He joined us for a boat ride on the river, which they inlcuded especially for me as I had shown interest in this. This kind of flexibility was wonderful!</div>
